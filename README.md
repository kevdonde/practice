# Practice 

This is just a small typescript / node repo of challenge questions that I may come across. I am just using this repository as a place to save them and work on them. I do not intend to provide links to the questions or the hidden tests from these sites like Hackerrank. The purpose of this is not provide free solutions to questions, as that would be cheating. :) However people can certainly feel free to use this code, however they wish, I hold no license over it. The purpose is simply a practice repo for myself.


## Installation

The repository has a devcontainer.json. You should be able to run `>Remote-containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container` from vscode. 

## Run the programs

From the command line you can then run any of the following commands as long as you `npm ci` or `npm install` first.

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
npm run test
```
